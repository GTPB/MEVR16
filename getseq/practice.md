# Practice

## Accessing Entrez with rentrez

- ```rentrez``` is an R package that interfaces with NCBI Eutils
- We will use this to perform tasks such as:
  - Obtain sequences from a list of GI numbers or accession numbers
  - Obtain sequences associated with a publication (PubMed record)
  - Obtain full length genomes of a viral species
- Not covered (but ask me!)
  - Finding 'background' sequences with BLAST
