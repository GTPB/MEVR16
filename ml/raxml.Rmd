# RAxML exercise

## Load the libraries

```{r}
library(ape)
library(ips)
```

## Read in the data

```{r}
myalignment <- read.dna("ray2000_aligned.fas",format="fasta",as.matrix=TRUE)
```

## Run RAxML

The ```raxml``` function is just a wrapper around the external program, and so this will need to be installed separately.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
myalignment.rax.gtr <- raxml(myalignment,
      m="GTRGAMMAIX", # model
      f="a", # best tree and bootstrap
      p=1234, # random number seed
      x=2345, # random seed for rapid bootstrapping
      N=100, # number of bootstrap replicates
      file="ray2000", # name of output files
      exec="raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE3", # name of executable
      threads=2
      )
```
