# Theory

## Introduction

- Methods that fit a model of molecular evolution to the sequence data are more computationally intensive, but typically show better performance than distance based methods

## How many trees?

- How many trees are possible with 12 sequences
- [ ] 105
- [ ] 10,295
- [ ] 2,027,025
- [x] 654,729,025

## Maximum likelihood inference

- The large number of trees makes it difficult to find the tree with the highest likelihood
- Phylogeny programs have to use heuristic approaches to find the 'best' tree
