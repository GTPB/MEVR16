# Maximum likelihood based analyses

Likelihood based approaches are computationally more intensive than distance based analyses, but are often more flexible and powerful. In this section, I will cover how we can use likelihood to test for which model of DNA evolution to use, and how to improve on an initial neighbour joining tree.
