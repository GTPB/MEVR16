# Tree reconstruction exercise

- I have provided a subset of 100 simulated sequences of HIV in FASTA format from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison Exercise, described [here](http://www.pangea-hiv.org/Projects/#phylodynamic).
- These sequences have been generated from a known phylogenetic tree
- The sequences comprise of three HIV genes:
  - gag
  - pol
  - env

- Run neighbour joining and maximum likelihood analyses in order to reconstruct phylogenies
- Compare the topology of the tree to the true tree using the function ```treedist``` in the ```phangorn``` library
