# Effective population size

## Introduction

- Given a clock-like tree, one of the quantities we can estimate is the *effective population size* over time assuming a coalescent model.
- This captures the rate at which the tree branches:
  - Small effective population size = high branching rate and short branches
  - Large effective population size = low branching rate and long branches
  
## What is the effective population size?

- Not simply the number of infected individuals
- For simple models

$N_e=I \tau /2$

$I$ = number of infected individuals
$\tau$ = average time between infections in the population ('generation time')

- As both change over the course of an epidemic, it is often hard to interpret effective population size epidemiologically
- However, during the epidemic growth phase, the rate of change of $N_e$ reflects the exponential growth rate of infected individuals

## Coalescent models vs. birth-death-sampling models

- Coalescent models assume the population size is changing deterministically
- Birth-death models allow for stochastic fluctuations in the population, but have not yet been extended to complex, nonlinear, structured populations
