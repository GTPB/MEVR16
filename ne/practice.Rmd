# Practice

## Introduction

- In the BEAST software package, there are many models of changing effective population size that can be fitted
- Parametric models
  - Exponential growth
  - Logistic growth
- Nonparametric models
  - 'Skyline', 'skyride' models

## Fitting models to a single tree

- We will fit a model to a single tree
  - Tree from chronos/LSD
  - One of the trees from a MrBayes run
- This is a fast, exploratory procedure
