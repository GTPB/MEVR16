# Practice

## 'Mugration' models

- There are several libraries in R that allow the modeling of a categorical trait on a fixed tree
  - ```ace``` in the library ```ape```
  - ```make.simmap``` in the library ```phytools``` performs stochastic character mapping
- BEAST allows the joint estimation of trees and traits

## Structured coalescent models

- Structured coalescent models can be fitted in R using the ```rcolgem``` library
- Currently beyond the scope of this course, but please see the vignettes in the ```rcolgem``` package
