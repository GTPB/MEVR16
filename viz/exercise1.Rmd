# Exercise

I have included the full MERS tree, with annotations. Using the templates in the walkthrough, work on making the tree look nice.

You can find additional resources here:

- ggtree blog entries [here](http://ygc.name/2014/12/21/ggtree/), [here](http://ygc.name/2015/02/10/ggtree-updating-a-tree-view/) and [here](http://ygc.name/2015/04/01/an-example-of-drawing-beast-tree-using-ggtree/)

If you have quantitative rather than qualitative traits, take a look at the ```phylobase``` and ```adephylo``` packages.
